# ⚙️ HJK InfiniteGear AI Engine

**Created by Hjk Maker**

HJK InfiniteGear is a theoretical recursive energy transformation and learning engine. It models a feedback-based logic loop where output energy powers future operations, allowing theoretical infinite operation based on dynamic parameters.

## 🔢 System Formula

```
Eₙ₊₁ = Eₙ + Gₙ - Lₙ
```

- `E` = Energy
- `G` = Gain (dynamic or static)
- `L` = Loss (simulated friction, heat, etc.)
